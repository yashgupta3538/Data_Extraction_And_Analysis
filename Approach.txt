1. Data Extraction:
   - Read the URLs from the provided Excel file (Input.xlsx).
   - Utilize Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse the HTML content of each URL.
   - Extract only the article title and text, excluding headers, footers, and other irrelevant content.
   - Save the extracted article text into separate text files, naming each file with the corresponding URL_ID.

2. Text Analysis:
   - Perform sentiment analysis:
     - Clean the text using stop words lists.
     - Create dictionaries of positive and negative words.
     - Calculate positive and negative scores, polarity score, and subjectivity score using predefined formulas.
   - Analyze readability:
     - Calculate average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index.
   - Compute average number of words per sentence, complex word count, word count, syllable count per word, personal pronouns count, and average word length according to the provided formulas.

3. Output Generation:
   - Save the computed variables for each article in the same order as specified in the output Excel file (Output Data Structure.xlsx).

4. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Implement error handling for invalid URLs or missing article text.
   - Validate the data extraction and analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.

5. Documentation:
   - Document the code appropriately for clarity and future reference.

By following this approach, I extracted the textual data from the provided URLs, perform text analysis to compute the required variables, and generate the output in the specified format.
